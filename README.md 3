# Emotion and Entity Analysis using NLP Techniques

This repository contains a comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on emotion classification, topic modeling, named entity recognition (NER), and semantic similarity analysis using state-of-the-art models such as Naive Bayes, CNN, RoBERTa, and BERT/Word2Vec embeddings.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Emotion Classification

#### 🔹 Naive Bayes
- Simple yet effective probabilistic classifier.
- Preprocessing includes tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and count vectorization.
- Good baseline performance with ~67% accuracy.

#### 🔹 CNN Model
- Used GloVe embeddings for transfer learning.
- Applied convolutional and pooling layers to learn text features.
- Achieved better performance than Naive Bayes (~70.2% accuracy and 0.63 F1-score).
- Learning curves indicate well-tuned training and validation.

### Task 2: Named Entity Recognition

#### 🔹 RoBERTa Sequence Tagger
- Used BIO tagging format with contextual embeddings.
- Achieved high precision and F1-score, especially effective in biomedical NER.
- Common errors and limitations analyzed with improvements suggested (e.g., Focal Loss, boundary correction).

### Task 3: Topic Modeling

#### 🔹 NMF for Joy and Optimism
- TF-IDF based topic extraction revealed well-separated, interpretable themes.
- Results visualize joy in events (e.g., birthdays, movies) and optimism in quotes and encouragement.

### Task 4: Entity Similarity

#### 🔹 BERT vs Word2Vec
- BERT captured semantic similarity better with contextual embeddings.
- Word2Vec performed faster but missed contextual richness.
- Diseases similar/dissimilar to "dyskinesia" were identified.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

For step-by-step execution, open the Jupyter Notebooks in your IDE or Jupyter environment.

Ensure that all required CSV and notebook files are in the same directory.
